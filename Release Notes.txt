============== Body PingPong v0.1 ================

This version is the first release for this game -- therefore not a major release. 
The second version is currenty under development. We look forward to getting response about bugs, 
features requests, new concepts, etc. Please use the SF.net site for reporting bugs and such.

This file explains what Body PingPong and hopefully from that you can make out what it isn't.

What Body PingPong is.
-----------------------

Body PingPong is a simple game that we intend to develop into a full multi-modal mixed-reality educational game.
What we mean by multi-modal is that players of the game will use (full) body movements instead of 
just their hands.

NOTE: For each version we will release Windows, Linux, and a source code archives.
